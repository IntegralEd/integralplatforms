        <p>Choosing the right LMS is a significant investment for education organizations. We help teams test, compare,
          and select learning management systems before deployment, using your org's real content and brand identity.
          This approach supports confident LMS adoption by making costs, feature tradeoffs, and long-term sustainability

        <h2 class="text-center">Representative Enterprise LMS Evaluation</h2>

        <h3>Client context</h3>
        <p>National nonprofit organization with over $1M in annual revenue from school district partnerships,
          delivering professional learning both online and in person across multiple programs and learner audiences.</p>

        <h3>Evaluation scope</h3>
        <p>As part of an enterprise LMS selection process, we evaluated multiple platforms head to head, including
          TalentLMS, Docebo, Canvas, Google Classroom, Tovuti, and others. Platforms were assessed against
          instructional, operational, reporting, governance, and budget requirements defined during requirements
          gathering.</p>

        <h3>Hands-on testing approach</h3>
        <p>During LMS free trial periods, we placed a representative sample eLearning lesson into each platform and
          applied the organization's branding to reflect real use. We created guided walkthroughs for learner and
          administrator workflows prioritized by the client team, enabling direct comparison using the organization's
          own content rather than vendor demos.</p>

        <h3>Decision outcome</h3>
        <p>This hands-on enterprise LMS evaluation allowed the organization to confidently disqualify platforms based
          on cost, complexity, and fit, ultimately selecting a best-fit LMS within budget that met the
          highest-priority requirements across programs.</p>

        <h3>Principle</h3>
        <p>There is no substitute for testing your own content inside each LMS. Experiencing real workflows, look and
          feel, and administration is essential to making an informed enterprise LMS decision and supporting long-term
          adoption.</p>
